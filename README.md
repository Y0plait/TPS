# TPS
## _A python torrent searcher_


TPS is a python movie researcher scrapper. It scraps data from ThePirateBay and Torrent9's sites (for the moment).

- Type the name of your movie
![SearchBar](https://github.com/Y0plait/TPS/tree/master/src/static/images/SearchBar.png "")
- Click on search
- And here you go !! A list with all the results with their name, magnet link, size and even number of seeders !

## Features
